# Normalize.sass

Normalize.sass is a port of Normalize.css to [indented Sass syntax](http://sass-lang.com/).

## What is Normalize?

Normalize is a stylesheet that makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. We researched the differences between default browser styles in order to precisely target only the styles that need normalizing.

## What does it do?

* Preserves useful defaults, unlike many CSS resets.
* Normalizes styles for a wide range of elements.
* Corrects bugs and common browser inconsistencies.
* Improves usability with subtle improvements.
* Explains what code does using detailed comments.

## How to use it

Normalize.sass is intended to be used as an alternative to reset stylesheets.

It's suggested that you read the `normalize.sass` file and consider customising it to meet your needs. Alternatively, include the file in your project and override the defaults later in your project's stylesheets.
